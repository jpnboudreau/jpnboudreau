- 👋 Hi, I’m @jpnboudreau
- 👀 I’m interested in learing how to make websites, programs and apps that aide in the mining industry where I worked for 20 years.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning from the ground floor... Spending the rest of 2021 taking as many classes as I can to further my knowledge!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that somebody is willing to let a newbie observe and learn.
- 📫 How to reach me jpnboudreau@icloud.com or (907) 723-6090
